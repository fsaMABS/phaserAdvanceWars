# Advance Wars Online
#### A Capstone Project by Brian Parrish, Abrar Sher, and Max Allen

## Welcome to Advance Wars Online

This is Advance Wars Online, a remake of the classic for the Nintendo Gameboy. Built into the browser using Javascript, Phaser, and Firebase, this 2-D turn-based strategy game can be played locally or online between two friends. Check 
out the Setup instructions below for using the codebase. 

# Setup
You’ll need to install a few things to setup...

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```git clone https://github.com/fsaMABS/phaserAdvanceWars```


## 2. Install dependencies (optionally you could install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

```npm install``` 

or if you choose yarn, just run ```yarn```

## 3. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser
